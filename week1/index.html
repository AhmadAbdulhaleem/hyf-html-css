            <p class="info">
                I'm 26 years old, a regular guy who comes from a country in Asia (Syria). I love
                little things in life and never take myself too seriously. Laughing with friends and enjoying life with
                my
                family are two of my favourite things.

                Since very young age I have been passionate about computers, like any other kid, right? Surely, but with
                one
                difference. I wanted to know how do things work in the background, how all those programs are made etc.,
                and
                I wanted to become a programmer.

    <!-- My Information -->
    <div class="my_info_2">
        I was sitting all day at my computer and trying to find some online books to read/learn more about coding
        because at the time YouTube wasn't like now and we didn't have a strong internet connection to be able to watch
        related videos, so the books were all we had.

        As soon as I started looking for books, I've realized that if I want to learn more about coding, I have to learn
        the English language first, because all those great books are written in English, and English is not my native
        language.
